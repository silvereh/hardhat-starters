# Get started with hardhat unit tests

- Create new npm project with `npm init`
- Install hardhat with `npm install --save-dev hardhat`
- Run hardhat with `npx hardhat` and select the complete project option.
- Replace `package.json` and `hardhat.config.js`
- Run `npm install`

Note: You can also use `yarn` instead of `npm` by using the commands
- `yarn add [package]` instead of `npm install [package]`
- `yarn [script]` instead of `npm run [script]`

## About the test suite

I included a basic test file in this folder, you can use it as a starting point for writing your tests.
